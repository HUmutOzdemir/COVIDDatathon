## Project Description

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the third coronavirus infection in two decades that was originally described in Asia, after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide, intensive care unit (ICU) practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, policy makers, and researchers must prepare for a surge in critically ill patients. We aim to provide an estimation about the effects of spreading COVID cases by evaluating in light of the usage and capacity of intensive care units (ICU) in Turkey.

## How to Use

We implemented all projects in a Jupyter Notebook. You can find the instructions to use in that notebook.
